The Jira toolkit provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with Jira, enabling users and AI applications to efficiently manage issues and projects. With this toolkit, you can:

- Create, update, and search for Jira issues using various parameters.
- Retrieve detailed information about issues, projects, users, and issue types.
- Manage issue labels and attachments, including adding and removing them.
- Transition issues between different statuses and manage comments on issues.
- Browse and list available projects, priorities, and users within Jira.
- Browse and list information of available boards and sprints within a Jira cloud.

This toolkit streamlines the process of issue management, making it easier to integrate Jira functionalities into applications and workflows.

<Warning>
  ## Handling multiple Atlassian Clouds

  A Jira user may have multiple Atlassian Clouds authorized via the same OAuth grant. In such cases, the Jira tools must be called with the `atlassian_cloud_id` argument. The [`Jira.GetAvailableAtlassianClouds`](/toolkits/productivity/jira#jiragetavailableatlassianclouds) tool can be used to get the available Atlassian Clouds and their IDs.

  When a tool call does not receive a value for `atlassian_cloud_id` and the user only has a single Atlassian Cloud authorized, the tool will use that. Otherwise, an error will be raised. The error will contain an additional content listing the available Atlassian Clouds and their IDs.

  Your AI Agent or AI-powered chat application can use the tool referenced above (or the exception's additional content) to guide the user into selecting the correct Atlassian Cloud.

  When the user selects an Atlassian Cloud, it may be appropriate to keep this information in the LLM's context window for subsequent tool calls, avoiding the need to ask the user multiple times.

  **_It is the job of the AI Agent or chat application to:_**

  1. Make it clear to the chat's end user which Atlassian Cloud is being used at any moment, to avoid, for example, having a Jira Issue being created in the wrong Atlassian Cloud;
  1. Appropriately instruct the LLM and keep the relevant information in its context window, enabling it to correctly call the Jira tools, **especially in multi-turn conversations**.
